Before resorting to pushing branches individually, troubleshoot why --mirror isn't working. This is unusual because --mirror should be pretty foolproof.
First, verify what you actually have locally:
bash# Show ALL branches (local and remote-tracking)
git branch -a

# Show just local branches
git branch

# Show remote-tracking branches
git branch -r
My suspicion: When you cloned from GitLab, you might only have gotten the default branch. GitLab clones don't automatically create local branches for all remote branches - they just create remote-tracking references.
Check your clone command - did you use:
bashgit clone <url>  # Only creates local branch for default branch
Or:
bashgit clone --mirror <url>  # Gets everything
If git branch -a shows branches like remotes/origin/feature-branch but git branch only shows main, that's your problem. You need to checkout all those remote branches as local branches before pushing.
Try this:
bash# Fetch all branches
git fetch --all

# Create local branches from all remote branches
for branch in $(git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | grep -v 'HEAD'); do
    git branch --track ${branch#origin/} $branch 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Now try mirror
git push --mirror
What does git branch -a show? That will tell us what's actually in your local clone.
